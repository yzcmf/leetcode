222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

class Solution {
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root == NULL) return 0;
        int hl=0, hr=0;
        TreeNode *l=root, *r=root;
        while(l) {hl++;l=l->left;}
        while(r) {hr++;r=r->right;}
        if(hl==hr) return pow(2,hl)-1;
        return 1+countNodes(root->left)+countNodes(root->right);
    }
