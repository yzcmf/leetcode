137. Single Number II

Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory? 

//Time:O(n);
//Space:O(1);
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int count[32] = {0};
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<32;i++)
        {
            for(auto v: nums)
            {
                count[i] += (v >> i) & 1; 
            }
            res |= (count[i]%3)<<i;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
