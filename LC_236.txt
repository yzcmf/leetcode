236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* A, TreeNode* B) {
         //Return either A or B or NULL
        if ( root == NULL || root == A || root == B) return root;
        TreeNode *left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, A, B);
        TreeNode *right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, A, B);
        //A and B are on both sides
        if (left != NULL && right != NULL) return root;
        //Either left or right or NULL
        if (left != NULL) return left;
        if (right != NULL) return right;
        return NULL;
